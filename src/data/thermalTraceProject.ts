  mainDescription: "Thermal Trace explores a new paradigm of fashion presentation by removing visual spectacle and foregrounding sensory engagement. Set in a secluded environment untouched by human intervention, this XR installation uses thermal detection to reveal camouflaged figuresâ€”merging body heat, environmental awareness, and spatial interaction. The project invites viewers to become active participants, shifting the role of the audience from passive observer to discoverer.",

  projectCategory: "XR Contents & Exhibition Design",
  teamType: "Solo Project",
  duration: "8 weeks",
  approach: "The work reimagines the runway as a perceptual landscape rather than a stage. Models and viewers alike are disguised to dissolve the boundary between object and subject. Physical presence becomes the primary interface, with proximity and body temperature guiding interaction. Mixed reality overlays augment the scene, constructing a layered exhibition space that blends tangible matter with ephemeral perception.",
  development: "A preliminary survey conducted with 56 participants supported the conceptual direction of this project. 78% responded positively to questions suggesting that fashion shows should move beyond conventional viewing formats and explore new experiential approaches."
