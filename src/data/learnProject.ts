  mainDescription: "Learn reframes climate science education by transforming abstract data into immersive, tactile experiences. Through AR-enhanced installations and interactive displays, the exhibition makes complex climate models accessible to diverse audiences. Set in a modular format suitable for schools, museums, and public spaces, Learn bridges the gap between scientific research and public understanding.",

  approach: "The project prioritizes hands-on learning over passive information consumption. Climate data is translated into spatial experiencesâ€”sea level rise becomes a physical walkthrough, temperature changes trigger responsive environments, and carbon cycles are visualized through interactive AR models. This approach transforms abstract scientific concepts into embodied knowledge.",
  development: "Research focused on educational psychology and science communication, particularly how spatial metaphors enhance comprehension of abstract concepts. The design methodology emphasized modularity, allowing individual components to function independently while maintaining narrative coherence across the full exhibition experience."
